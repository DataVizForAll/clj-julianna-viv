          <h2>Introduction</h2>
         
 
          <p>Traditional public schools have been around for centuries, can they still serve modern communities needs? In Connecticut there has been a call for change and the response has been interdistrict choice schools. This type of school includes Magnet, Charter, and Technical schools. They are all still public schools, but students do not end up there based on just their neighborhood. The dominant form of interdistrict choice school in Connecticut is magnet schools. There are just over 100 magnet schools in Connecticut, but here we will be predominantly focusing on Hartford. Using data that we collected from the public domain we have created a series of data visualizations to show where these public schools – both traditional and nontraditional – are located and how many students they serve.</p>

 <p>For our data story, we looked at public choice and traditional public schools in the Hartford and non Hartford areas. We first made a chart showing the student population of public choice schools in Hartford. This chart showing <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/RyMgf/">Student population of public choice schools in Hartford</a> shows the population of all magnet, charter and technical schools. From the data, we have found that Hartford magnet Trinity College academy school had the highest population of 979 students.</p>

          <p>The next chart we made shows the traditional public school enrollments in Hartford schools. As seen in Figure 1, the Hartford public high school had the highest enrollment of 844 students, and the Renzulli gifted and talented academy had the lowest enrollment of 122 students.</p>

          <p>These charts range from pre-k to high schools in the Hartford area. They have given us a good understanding of where most of the choice schools and traditional public schools fall in Hartford. We also made zoomed in versions of the map, showing where each of the schools specifically are in Hartford. This chart shows <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/T3EJ3/">Traditional public schools in Hartford by student population</a> and it is a more zoomed in version of the interactive chart that is shown in Figure 1. </p>

          <p>After looking into schools in Hartford, we also looked at data from schools around the Hartford area.</p>

          <p>This map shows <a href='https://www.datawrapper.de/_/556XX/'>Traditional public schools in the Hartford area</a>.
